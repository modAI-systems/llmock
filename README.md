# AI-First Project Template

This repository is optimized for AI-driven development.

## 🤖 AI Onboarding
If you are an AI agent working on this repository, please start by reading:
1.  **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)**: Rules of engagement, workflow protocols, and project knowledge.
2.  **[docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md](./docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md)**: Current state of the system and technology choices.

## 🚀 Key Protocols
- **Skill Acquisition**: Investigate and document new technologies in `docs/skills/` before coding.
- **Architecture First**: Review and update architecture before implementing new features.
- **TDD**: Tests must exist and pass for a task to be considered complete.
- **Learning Loop**: Update instructions in `docs/learnings/INSTRUCTION_UPDATES.md` when corrected.

## 📁 Directory Structure
- `docs/`: Central documentation hub.
    - `architecture/`: Design decisions.
    - `skills/`: Technology-specific knowledge base.
    - `learnings/`: Persistent memory of improvements.
- `AGENTS.md`: The "brain" of the project for LLMs.
